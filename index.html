      <p class="text-muted">St. Xavier Church, is a Roman Catholic Latin Rite shrine in Kottar, Nagercoil, in the Kanyakumari district of Tamil Nadu state, India. While Francis Xavier was doing missionary work in Kottar and its neighbourhood, he averted an invasion of Vadugas with the help of the army of Paravars and Padaiyatchis of Kottar, at Vadasery, thus protecting the people of the Venad kingdom from that attack which was appreciated by the king, Unni Kerala Varma, who became closer to the priest and befriended him from then on. In recognition of Xavier’s services, the king allotted him a piece of land to construct a Catholic church, as a gesture of goodwill, as per the church records. </p>

    <p class="text-muted">The stage has always been held in great honour at St. Xavier’s. For an educational institution an auditorium is not just a venue for school or college events, or merely a meeting place, it is a space where a corporation of students and scholars congregate – to celebrate, to debate, to discuss, and sometimes even to mourn collectively. As we stand at the threshold of another century in the history of St. Xavier’s College, it is meet that we go down memory lane and find out how students gathered here when it all began 130 odd years ago, how this place changed over the century, and how it is now poised to provide a space for even greater creative, cultural and social events, something that St. Xavier’s School has always been noted for.</p>

    <p>Good morning/ evening to everyone present here. 
      Thank you for bestowing me with such an honour and this special award.
       I feel overwhelmed and emotional and I am at a loss for words, this is a very special moment in my life.
        It already felt like a win when I found out that I am even being considered for this honorary award.
      First of all, let me start by saying I am so grateful to be standing here in front of you with this award.
      Thank you to the senior authorities of this prestigious institution to recognize my work in all these years. 
      All the contenders for this award, I look up to all of you. 
      You have set the benchmark of excellence for me, and to be on the same list as you were already a great achievement for me.
      Teaching is always considered to be a selfless profession and many don't even acknowledge our efforts so the fact that our institution hosts an award ceremony for teachers is really commendable. 
      We all are aware that teaching is a tough profession but when the administration, teachers, and parents award us with such a special honour it really solidifies our belief and boosts our morale to continue to do good work</p>

      <p>The greatest reward of success is the satisfaction that an individual attains by achieving a goal.
         Success is the offspring of hard work and determination.
          Without both these parents, success will not be born. In order to be successful in life, an individual has to set up goals and work for them.
           Many people will do the first part — setting the goal right, but they forget the main part — working for it.
            No seed will be ready to be reaped unless it is sowed and cared for.</p>
